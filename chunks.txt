Climate Change Overview Climate change refers to significant changes in global temperatures and weather patterns over time. Human activity, especially the burning of fossil fuels, has been a primary driver of recent climate change. This causes glaciers to melt, sea levels to rise, and extreme weathe
r to become more frequent. 
Basics of Artificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science aimed at building machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. This includes learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and language understanding. AI applications range from chatbo
ts to autonomous vehicles and medical diagnostics. 
Introduction to Renewable Energy Renewable energy comes from sources that naturally replenish, such as sunlight, wind, and water flow. It is a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels that helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Common types include solar power, wind turbines, and hydroelectric energy
